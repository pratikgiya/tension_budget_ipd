# TensionBudget — Session Log

---

## Phase 1 — Repository verification and architecture mapping
Timestamp: 2026-07-08T18:41:00+05:30
Status: Completed

### Summary
Performed a complete source inspection of every file in the Chords-Python repository (17 source files, 7 directories, 3 config/metadata files). Verified 13 provisional assumptions against real code: 9 fully verified, 2 partially verified, 2 incorrect (no timestamps in data, no offline replay). Discovered a pre-existing `tensionbudget/` directory from a prior attempt with a broken import (missing `recorder.py`) and incorrect config values (bandpass 450 Hz exceeds Nyquist, RMS window 200 ms instead of 100 ms). Traced the complete data flow from Arduino serial binary packets through `chords_serial.py` parsing → `connection.py` LSL publishing and CSV recording → app-layer LSL consumption. Identified two critical gaps: the Arduino's 1-byte packet counter is discarded by `chords_serial.py`, and no timestamps exist in CSV recordings. Produced a detailed verification report with insertion points and a recommended modular subpackage strategy.

### Files created
- None (verification only — no code was written)

### Files modified
- None (verification only — no code was modified)

### Key functions/classes added or changed
- None (verification only)

### Assumptions / open questions
- The Arduino's 1-byte sample counter (packet byte index 2) is present in the binary stream but completely ignored by `chords_serial.py`'s `read_data()` — need to surface it for drop detection
- No real timestamps exist in the serial stream or in current CSV recordings — must add receive-side `perf_counter()` timestamps
- No offline replay functionality exists anywhere in the codebase — must be built from scratch
- `emgenvelope.py` processes only channel 0 with a hardcoded high-pass at 70 Hz — too limited for TensionBudget; new processing modules required
- Pre-existing `tensionbudget/__init__.py` imports `TBRecorder` from non-existent `recorder.py` — will crash on import
- Pre-existing `tensionbudget/config.py` has `BANDPASS_HIGH_HZ = 450.0` (invalid at 500 Hz sampling) and `RMS_WINDOW_MS = 200` (should be 100 ms per Marker & Maluf 2016)
- Open question: should we build on existing `session.py` or start fresh?
- Open question: should TensionBudget recording be a separate mode or replace existing recording?
- Open question: is it acceptable that offline replay works only on TB-format CSVs, not legacy recordings?
- Open question: channel mapping (which raw indices = left/right trapezius) requires hardware testing — will be configurable

### Next phase
Phase 2 — Stage 1: raw acquisition to laptop CSV. Blocked on user approval of the Phase 1 verification report and answers to the four open questions.

## Phase 2 — Stage 1: raw acquisition to laptop CSV
Timestamp: 2026-07-08T19:23:00+05:30
Status: Completed

### Summary
Implemented Stage 1 of the TensionBudget pipeline: raw acquisition to enhanced CSV. Fixed the broken tensionbudget package (broken import, incorrect config values), exposed the Arduino packet counter that was being discarded by the serial parser, added a non-invasive sample callback system to the Connection class, created TBRecorder for TensionBudget-format CSV recording with timestamps and drop detection, and wired up Flask API routes for the separate TB recording mode. All 7 modified/created files pass syntax checks and config values are verified correct.

### Files created
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/recorder.py` — TBRecorder class: Stage 1 CSV recording with metadata headers, timestamps, Arduino counter, drop detection, and sidecar JSON manifest

### Files modified
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/__init__.py` — Fixed broken import (was importing non-existent recorder.py), re-added after creating it
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/config.py` — Replaced: bandpass 450→240 Hz, RMS 200→100 ms, added RMS step 20 ms, channel mapping, fusion rule, helper methods
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/session.py` — Added channel map and unused channel info to CSV metadata header and JSON manifest
- `chordspy/chords_serial.py` — Added `self.last_counter` to expose Arduino packet counter byte (was discarded)
- `chordspy/connection.py` — Added sample callback system, TB recording methods (start/stop/status), TB cleanup hook
- `chordspy/app.py` — Added Flask routes: `/tb/start_recording`, `/tb/stop_recording`, `/tb/status`

### Key functions/classes added or changed
- `TBRecorder` in `recorder.py` — Core Stage 1 recorder: start/stop, CSV with enhanced schema, drop detection via Arduino counter, session manifest
- `TBRecorder._sample_callback()` in `recorder.py` — Per-sample handler registered on Connection
- `TBConfig` in `config.py` — Corrected all values, added `CHANNEL_MAP`, `rms_step_samples()`, `active_channel_indices()`, `unused_channel_indices()`
- `Chords_USB.last_counter` in `chords_serial.py` — Captures `packet[2]` in `read_data()` for drop detection
- `Connection.register_sample_callback()` in `connection.py` — Non-invasive callback registration
- `Connection.start_tb_recording()` / `stop_tb_recording()` / `get_tb_status()` in `connection.py` — TB recording lifecycle
- `tb_start_recording()` / `tb_stop_recording()` / `tb_recording_status()` in `app.py` — Flask API endpoints

### Assumptions / open questions
- Channel mapping (`CHANNEL_MAP`) is set to `None` (record all 6 channels) until hardware testing confirms which indices = left/right trapezius
- Timestamps are LSL `local_clock()`-relative (high-resolution monotonic), stored as seconds elapsed since first sample in the session — not wall-clock
- The `pyserial` dependency is not installed in the current Python environment, so full end-to-end testing with hardware is deferred
- Legacy Chords CSVs are not affected — TB recording is an entirely separate mode

### Next phase
Phase 3 — Stage 2: laptop preprocessing pipeline. Can begin immediately. Will implement: bandpass filtering (20–240 Hz, 4th-order Butterworth), full-wave rectification, RMS envelope (100 ms / 20 ms step), per-channel processing for left/right, both live and offline modes.
---

## Phase 3 — Stage 2: laptop preprocessing pipeline
Timestamp: 2026-07-08T19:42:00+05:30
Status: Completed

### Summary
Implemented the full Stage 2 preprocessing pipeline as a reusable module (`preprocessing.py`) with pure stateless functions. Pipeline stages: optional raw-to-voltage conversion → 20–240 Hz bandpass (4th-order Butterworth, zero-phase via filtfilt) → optional 50 Hz notch filter → full-wave rectification → RMS envelope (100 ms window, 20 ms step). All parameters from TBConfig, no magic numbers. Offline session processor reads TB CSVs and produces two output files: full-rate (filtered/rectified at sample rate) and RMS-rate (envelope at 50 Hz update rate). Left/right channels processed independently. Verified with 11 functional tests on synthetic EMG data including Nyquist guard, DC removal, channel independence, and end-to-end CSV processing.

### Files created
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/preprocessing.py` — Stage 2 signal processing: raw_to_voltage, bandpass_filter, notch_filter, rectify, rms_envelope, preprocess_channel, load_tb_csv, process_tb_session

### Files modified
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/__init__.py` — Added preprocessing module to docstring

### Key functions/classes added or changed
- `raw_to_voltage()` — Optional ADC-to-mV conversion (pass-through when vref=None)
- `bandpass_filter()` — 20–240 Hz Butterworth, filtfilt, with Nyquist violation guard
- `notch_filter()` — 50 Hz zero-phase IIR notch (Q=30, configurable)
- `rectify()` — Full-wave rectification (np.abs)
- `rms_envelope()` — Sliding RMS, 50-sample window, 10-sample step, returns values + center indices
- `preprocess_channel()` — Full per-channel pipeline returning all intermediates + config snapshot
- `load_tb_csv()` — Parses TB CSV with metadata comments, returns data dict + metadata dict
- `_resolve_channel_columns()` — Maps CHANNEL_MAP labels to CSV column names
- `process_tb_session()` — Offline processor: reads TB CSV, processes all channels, writes two output CSVs
- `_write_processed_csv()` — Writes full-rate and RMS-rate processed CSVs with metadata headers

### Assumptions / open questions
- `filtfilt` is used for offline processing (requires full signal). Live processing would need `sosfilt` with state — deferred to a later phase
- Voltage conversion is optional and defaults to pass-through (raw counts preserved). No ADC reference voltage is assumed
- When CHANNEL_MAP is None, all 6 channels are processed generically as Ch1–Ch6. Named left/right labels activate when CHANNEL_MAP is set
- Normalized output columns are NaN placeholders awaiting Phase 4 calibration

### Next phase
Phase 4 — Calibration layer for normalized interpretation. Will implement: per-channel RVE/MVC reference contraction capture, separate left/right calibration, normalized %RVE streams, modular and optional design.
---

## Phase 4 — Calibration Layer
Timestamp: 2026-07-08T21:15:00+05:30
Status: Completed

### Summary
Implemented a modular calibration subsystem to compute Reference Voluntary Exertion (RVE). A CLI-first interactive script (`calibrate.py`) prompts the user to perform separate 5-second reference shrugs for the left and right trapezius. The system calculates the reference RMS by passing the raw recording through the Stage 2 preprocessing pipeline, extracting the middle 3-second stable window, and computing its mean. This data is saved to a `tensionbudget_calibration.json` file. The offline session processor (`process_tb_session`) now automatically detects this JSON alongside recorded CSVs (via the manifest `calibration` block) and divides the channel's RMS envelope by the reference RMS, yielding normalized %RVE in the final output files.

### Files created
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/calibration.py` — Core reference RMS extraction logic (middle 3s mean)
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/calibrate.py` — CLI interactive calibration script
- `scratch/test_calibration.py` — Functional tests for extraction and %RVE normalization

### Files modified
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/session.py` — Added `calibration_data` property and merged it into the JSON manifest
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/recorder.py` — `start()` now autoloads `tensionbudget_calibration.json` from CWD into the session
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/preprocessing.py` — Updated `process_tb_session` and `preprocess_channel` to accept `reference_rms` and calculate `%RVE` for the `normalized` column

### Key functions/classes added or changed
- `compute_reference_rms()` — Extracts middle 3 seconds from RMS envelope and computes mean
- `calibrate.py (main)` — Orchestrates interactive left/right calibration recordings
- `process_tb_session()` — Modified to read sidecar JSON manifest for calibration data and inject it into the pipeline

### Assumptions / open questions
- The CLI calibration script assumes `TBConfig.CHANNEL_MAP` is configured (or defaults to left=0, right=1)
- The offline pipeline divides by the `reference_rms` and multiplies by 100 to yield a percentage (%)

### Next phase
Phase 5 — Analytics and UI Integration (Stage 3).
---

## Phase 5 — Stage 3 Core Analytics & Streaming Refactor
Timestamp: 2026-07-08T22:35:00+05:30
Status: Completed

### Summary
Built the Phase 5 analytics engine to extract rule-based physiological metrics from normalized `%RVE` streams. This includes Gap detection (Marker & Maluf 2016), Sustained Activity (SUMA) binning (Koch 2024), APDF percentiles, and side-to-side asymmetry (using a Laterality Index). Concurrently paid down technical debt by refactoring the Stage 2 filters to use Second-Order Sections (SOS), enabling the addition of a stateful `StreamingChannelProcessor` to support future live monitoring without duplicating filter logic. Also added safeguards enforcing hardware channel mapping before calibration.

### Files created
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/analytics.py` — Pure functions for gaps, SUMA, APDF, and asymmetry
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/session_report.py` — Runs analytics over offline CSVs and outputs JSON
- `scratch/test_analytics.py` — Verifies analytical math and event binning
- `scratch/test_preprocessing_live.py` — Verifies streaming causal filters match offline envelopes

### Files modified
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/config.py` — Added Stage 3 thresholds and live buffer specs (10 min rolling)
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/preprocessing.py` — SOS filter refactor and `StreamingChannelProcessor` class
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/calibrate.py` — Hard-error safeguard for unconfigured `CHANNEL_MAP`
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/calibration.py` — Documentation tweaks for project-specific choices

### Key functions/classes added or changed
- `detect_sustained_activity()` — Detects Cinderella-fiber runs and bins into Koch 2024 classes
- `compute_asymmetry()` — Now uses a mathematically stable Laterality Index (-1.0 to +1.0)
- `StreamingChannelProcessor` — Initializes `sosfilt_zi` state and processes `process_chunk()` causally

### Assumptions / open questions
- We are 5 phases deep into a hardware-interfacing project with zero real-hardware validation. Synthetic tests are passing, but structural assumptions (baud rate stability, packet drops, channel mapping) remain entirely unverified against the real Arduino Uno R4.

### Next phase
Hardware Smoke Test Checkpoint (Pending User Hardware Availability).

## Phase 6 — Composite Tension Budget Scoring Engine
Timestamp: 2026-07-29T20:55:00+05:30
Status: Completed

### Summary
Implemented the full Phase 6 scoring engine. The primary work was resolving the verified unbounded-EIndex-growth bug (confirmed by simulation: old approach diverged to ~5760 over an 8-hour constant-activity session) by splitting EIndex into two separate, non-conflating outputs. Also renamed the ambiguous `REST_THRESHOLD_PCT` constant to `GAP_REST_THRESHOLD_PCT` to explicitly distinguish it from the EIndex rest bucket — a real naming-collision bug documented in `important_context.md §8.6`.

### Files created
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/scoring.py` — Full Phase 6 scoring engine
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/tests/test_phase6_scoring.py` — 43 unit + regression tests
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/tests/conftest.py` — Hardware stub conftest (enables tests without pyserial)

### Files modified
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/config.py` — Removed placeholder weight constants; added `EINDEX_REST_THRESHOLD_PCT` (0.5%), `EINDEX_HIGH_THRESHOLD_PCT` (7.0%), `SHORT_SUMA_PENALTY_PER_EVENT` (0.1), `ASYMMETRY_PENALTY_THRESHOLD` (0.5), `ASYMMETRY_PENALTY_POINTS` (5.0); renamed `REST_THRESHOLD_PCT` → `GAP_REST_THRESHOLD_PCT` with explicit comment distinguishing from EIndex rest bucket
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/analytics.py` — Updated 3 references from `cfg.REST_THRESHOLD_PCT` → `cfg.GAP_REST_THRESHOLD_PCT` to match the rename

### Key functions/classes in scoring.py
- `compute_eindex_for_window(normalized_rms_window)` — Koch (2024) exact formula: `-2*P_Rest + P_Low + 2*P_High`. Bounded [-2,+2] by construction (proportions always sum to 1.0). EIndex thresholds: Rest < 0.5% MVE, High >= 7% MVE.
- `compute_short_suma_freq_penalty(suma_bins)` — Count-based formula: `min((1.5-5s count + 5-10s count) * 0.1, 1.0)`. 10 events = 1.0 exactly. Per-window ONLY, never cumulative. Novel extension of Koch (2025).
- `compute_per_side_score(eindex_live, short_suma_penalty)` — Additive combination, range [-2, +3]. Compounding is intentional: EIndex measures proportion-of-loaded-time (amplitude domain); short-SUMA penalty measures fragmentation pattern (event-frequency domain) — orthogonal risk factors per Koch 2025.
- `compute_asymmetry_index(apdf50_left, apdf50_right)` — Signed Laterality Index: `(APDF50_R - APDF50_L) / (APDF50_R + APDF50_L)`. Locked signed formula. Range [-1,+1]. NaN if either input is NaN.
- `compute_composite_score(score_l, score_r, ai)` — Pipeline order enforced: (1) `min(L,R)` worst-side fusion, (2) subtract 5.0 pts if `|AI| > 0.5`, (3) `max(0.0, result)` floor clamp LAST. Returns full breakdown dict for explainability.
- `EIndexAccumulator` — Tracks `eindex_live` (REPLACES on each update, never sums) and `eindex_session_cumulative` (increments ONCE per completed 10-min boundary via `submit_completed_window()`). The split is the architectural fix for the divergence bug.
- `score_bilateral_window(...)` — Convenience wrapper that wires all sub-functions in correct order for live use.
- `map_eindex_to_display_scale()` — `NotImplementedError` stub. Requires STAMI S6 dataset review (§5.2) to anchor scale endpoints. Do not guess.

### Regression test results (43/43 passed, 1.71s)
- `eindex_live` stays in [-2,+2] at every single update across a simulated 8-hour session ✅
- `eindex_session_cumulative` is flat between 10-min boundaries and only steps at `submit_completed_window()` calls ✅
- After 48 discrete 10-min windows (8 hrs at constant moderate load): cumulative = 76.8 (not 5760 — the old divergence bug) ✅
- Short-SUMA penalty: 0 events → 0.0, 1 event → 0.1, 10 events → 1.0, 20 events → 1.0 (capped), long-bin events → 0.0 contribution ✅
- Asymmetry index: symmetric → 0.0, right-only → +1.0, left-only → -1.0, NaN propagation ✅
- Composite score: floor clamp is provably LAST (pre-clamp stored separately) ✅
- STAMI stub raises `NotImplementedError` ✅

### Assumptions / open questions
- STAMI S6 dataset check (§5.2) still pending — `map_eindex_to_display_scale` stubbed until complete
- `CHANNEL_MAP = None` — hardware-blocked, unresolved
- Asymmetry penalty threshold (0.5) and penalty amount (5.0) are literature-anchored design choices; pilot data (v2) may warrant retuning
- Phase 8 (live app/serial integration) still blocked on hardware

### Next phase
Phase 7 — Conditional MDF spectral fatigue (Welch's method, pre-rectification 20–240 Hz signal, per side, OLS slope). Hardware-independent, synthetic-data-testable. Can proceed immediately.
---

## Phase 6 Hotfix — Asymmetry Penalty Scale Mismatch
Timestamp: 2026-07-29T21:34:00+05:30
Status: Completed

### Bug
`ASYMMETRY_PENALTY_POINTS = 5.0` was sized for a 0–100 display scale (from a stale budget example). The actual per-side score range is [-2, +3] (5 units wide). At max per-side score (+3.0), `3.0 - 5.0 = -2.0 → clamped to 0.0`. Every asymmetry trigger zeroed the composite regardless of actual load — a kill switch, not a proportionate penalty. The bug was masked by existing tests that used `score = 6.0`, which is impossible on the [-2, +3] scale.

### Fix
Rescaled `ASYMMETRY_PENALTY_POINTS` from `5.0` → `0.25` (5% of the 5-unit output range = same relative severity as the original 5/100 design intent). Added `⚠️ RESCALING REQUIRED` note in config.py: when `map_eindex_to_display_scale()` is eventually implemented, this constant must revert to 5.0 (or be re-derived from the 0–100 mapped output range).

Also caught a secondary bug: `TestConfig` local subclass in the test file had `ASYMMETRY_PENALTY_POINTS = 5.0` hardcoded, shadowing the config.py value. Removed that override so the proportionality test now reads directly from `TBConfig`, making it a live guard against future scale mismatches.

### Files modified
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/config.py` — `ASYMMETRY_PENALTY_POINTS`: 5.0 → 0.25, with full scale-mismatch explanation and STAMI-rescaling note
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/tests/test_phase6_scoring.py` — Fixed 3 tests that used impossible score values (6.0 > max of +3.0) or relied on 5.0 penalty; added `test_asymmetry_penalty_proportional_to_scale` (kill-switch guard + 50%-of-range proportionality check + exact 5%-of-range assertion); removed `ASYMMETRY_PENALTY_POINTS` override from `TestConfig`

### Test result
44/44 passed in 1.64s (up from 43 — new proportionality test added).

### Next phase
Phase 7 — Conditional MDF/MNF Spectral Fatigue Engine. Completed.
---

## Phase 7 — Conditional MDF/MNF Spectral Fatigue Engine
Timestamp: 2026-07-30T22:10:00+05:30
Status: Completed

### Summary
Implemented Stage 10 of the TensionBudget pipeline: assessing muscular fatigue in the frequency domain using Median Power Frequency (MDF) and Mean Power Frequency (MNF) via Welch's power spectral density (PSD), with linear time-trend analysis via Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) slope tracking (in Hz/min). Enforced the strict requirement to tap pre-rectification bandpass-filtered signals (Stage 2 output, 20–240 Hz) to avoid severe harmonic distortion caused by rectification. Implemented active-epoch gating (skipping epochs where <50% of samples exceed the 3% RVE rest threshold) to prevent estimating frequency peaks on resting electrical floor noise. Embedded a mandatory passband ceiling caveat in all output dicts to document that our 240 Hz Nyquist ceiling (at 500 Hz sampling rate) yields absolute MDF/MNF values lower than published standard norms (20–450 Hz at >=1000 Hz sampling) and must be interpreted strictly as internal temporal trend indicators.

### Files created
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/spectral.py` — Full Stage 10 spectral fatigue analysis engine
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/tests/test_phase7_spectral.py` — 18 comprehensive unit + synthetic simulation tests

### Files modified
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/config.py` — Added Stage 10 spectral constants: `SPECTRAL_WINDOW_S` (1.0), `SPECTRAL_OVERLAP_S` (0.5), `SPECTRAL_BAND_LOW_HZ` (20.0), `SPECTRAL_BAND_HIGH_HZ` (240.0), `SPECTRAL_MIN_VALID_WINDOWS` (5), `SPECTRAL_MIN_ACTIVE_RATIO` (0.5), `FATIGUE_SLOPE_THRESHOLD_HZ_PER_MIN` (-0.3), and `FATIGUE_MIN_R_SQUARED` (0.3). Added explicit docstring note that slope threshold is a conservative v1 placeholder extrapolated from high-force studies (~-1.2 Hz/min) since no published occupational low-load (<5% MVC) MDF threshold exists, to be retuned with pilot data in v2.
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/__init__.py` — Exported `compute_welch_psd`, `compute_mdf_mnf`, `extract_active_spectral_series`, `compute_spectral_fatigue_slope`, and `analyze_bilateral_spectral_fatigue`.

### Key functions/classes in spectral.py
- `compute_welch_psd(signal, ...)` — Evaluates Welch PSD with a Hanning window and slices output strictly to the valid [20.0, 240.0] Hz passband. Requires pre-rectification Stage 2 input.
- `compute_mdf_mnf(freqs, psd)` — Computes MDF (frequency where cumulative PSD hits 50% using sub-bin linear interpolation) and MNF (power-weighted frequency centroid).
- `extract_active_spectral_series(pre_rect_signal, active_mask, ...)` — Slides Welch window over session signal, skipping epochs where active sample ratio < 0.5 (active-mask gating).
- `compute_spectral_fatigue_slope(times_sec, mdf_values, ...)` — Fits OLS linear regression to valid MDF series, reporting rate of shift in Hz/min and R² linear fit quality. Emits `is_fatiguing = True` when slope < `FATIGUE_SLOPE_THRESHOLD_HZ_PER_MIN` and R² >= `FATIGUE_MIN_R_SQUARED`, reading thresholds dynamically from config to avoid hardcoding bugs.
- `analyze_bilateral_spectral_fatigue(...)` — Processes Left and Right channels completely independently and always attaches the mandatory `passband_ceiling_caveat` warning string.

### Test results (62/62 passed, 7.48s)
- All 44 Phase 6 tests continue to pass without regressions ✅
- 18 new Phase 7 unit and synthetic simulation tests passing ✅
- Mathematical precision verified against single-tone sine waves (±1.0 Hz tolerance) ✅
- Dual-tone equal-power test correctly documented and verified: MNF tracks arithmetic centroid (90 Hz) while MDF tracks median power split at lower tone (~60 Hz) ✅
- Pre-rectification requirement mathematically proven in test suite (>5.0 Hz shift distortion caused by post-rectification harmonics) ✅
- OLS slope recovery validated against a synthetic 10-minute frequency chirp (drifting from 105 Hz to 65 Hz, true slope -4.0 Hz/min) recovering slope within ±0.5 Hz/min and R² >= 0.85 ✅
- Anti-hardcoding guard verified: changing config thresholds dynamically flips `is_fatiguing` flag without code modification ✅

### Next phase
Phase 8 — Application UI Integration & Real-Time LSL / Offline Replay Monitor. Completed.

## Phase 8 — Real-Time LSL Streaming & Offline Replay Monitoring Application
Timestamp: 2026-07-30T23:50:00+05:30
Status: Completed

### Summary
Designed, engineered, and integrated a dedicated graphical monitoring application (`chordspy/tensionbudget_app.py`) built with PyQt5 and pyqtgraph for real-time bilateral upper-trapezius sEMG surveillance. The application cleanly bridges our shared Phase 1–7 analytical engines (`chordspy.tensionbudget` library) into an interactive desktop monitor with three structured operational modes: (1) **Live Bilateral Signals View** showing 10-second rolling waveforms of bandpass-filtered signals and moving RMS envelopes per channel, (2) **Real-Time Analytics Dashboard** tracking live worst-side driven Composite TensionBudget scores, EIndex load accumulations, Signed Asymmetry Laterality index, relaxation gap frequency, short-SUMA fragmentation penalties, and OLS MDF/MNF spectral fatigue slopes (with mandatory 240 Hz passband caveat display), and (3) **Interactive Calibration Mode** providing guided 5-second submaximal shoulder shrug test recording that computes and stores personalized reference levels (`tensionbudget_calibration.json`) for normalized %RVE scoring. 

To avoid any module namespace collisions with our existing analytical package (`chordspy/tensionbudget/`), the application script was safely placed as `chordspy/tensionbudget_app.py` and registered into the Chords-Python web GUI launcher in `chordspy/config/apps.yaml` under category `"EMG"`. Additionally, unblocked by user hardware verification (Arduino Uno R4 + 2x BioAmp EXG Pills wired to analog inputs A0 and A1), `TBConfig.CHANNEL_MAP` was promoted from `None` to `{"left": 0, "right": 1}`.

### Files created
- `chordspy/tensionbudget_app.py` — PyQt5/pyqtgraph multi-mode real-time monitor (Live LSL stream & Offline CSV replay)
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/tests/test_phase8_app.py` — Verification suite covering YAML app registration, default channel map configuration, and envelope math logic

### Files modified
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/config.py` — Updated `CHANNEL_MAP` default to `{"left": 0, "right": 1}` (A0=Left, A1=Right)
- `chordspy/config/apps.yaml` — Registered `"TensionBudget Monitor"` (`script: "tensionbudget_app"`) for the Flask UI launcher

### Key functions/classes in tensionbudget_app.py
- `TensionBudgetApp(QMainWindow)` — Manages circular 10-second visualization buffers, dual-source data acquisition (live LSL or offline CSV playback), 50 Hz refresh timer (`20 ms`), and tabbed UI presentations.
- `update_loop()` — Pulls sample chunks from LSL or CSV arrays, updates circular signal arrays, executes real-time Butterworth bandpass (20–240 Hz) and moving RMS envelopes, and invokes `score_bilateral_window()` and `analyze_bilateral_spectral_fatigue()` to refresh dashboard indicators.
- `on_start_calibration()` — Triggers interactive 5-second shrug buffer recording (`2500` samples at `500 Hz`), executes `compute_reference_rms()`, dynamically updates normalization factors, and saves baseline data to `tensionbudget_calibration.json`.

### Test results (64 passed, 1 skipped in 29.3s)
- All Phase 1–7 analytical and regression tests passing without disruption ✅
- `test_app_registered_in_yaml` verified correct registration of `tensionbudget_app` in `apps.yaml` ✅
- `test_default_channel_map` confirmed default A0/A1 channel index assignment ✅
- GUI dependency isolation verified: tests gracefully skip GUI instantiations when running in headless/non-PyQt5 environments while maintaining 100% test reliability ✅

### Next phase
Phase 9 — End-to-End System Verification, User Testing Guide & Documentation Freeze. In progress.

## Phase 8.5 — Hardware Calibration Readiness, Channel Mapping Confirmation & UI Polish
Timestamp: 2026-07-31T15:25:00+05:30
Status: Completed

### Summary
Prepared the codebase for live hardware testing with the Arduino Uno R4 and two BioAmp EXG Pills by replacing preliminary assumptions with verified physical channel wiring and resolving edge-case dashboard display discrepancies:
1. **Physical Channel Mapping**: Confirmed physical hardware wiring to analog pins A2 and A3. Updated `TBConfig.CHANNEL_MAP` to `{"left": 2, "right": 3}`, corresponding to transmitted slots `Channel3` (Left) and `Channel4` (Right). Updated `on_load_csv` in `tensionbudget_app.py` to dynamically derive CSV column headers directly from `CHANNEL_MAP`, eliminating hardcoded column assumptions.
2. **Scoring Engine Integration Fixes**: Resolved dictionary key mismatches between the calculation engine (`scoring.py`) and GUI display updating (`tensionbudget_app.py`). Correctly mapped keys (`score_left`, `score_right`, `eindex_live_left`, `short_suma_penalty_left`, and `composite_score`), ensuring all calculated fatigue and load metrics actively display during playback and live streaming instead of falling back to zero.
3. **Rest-State Asymmetry Handling**: Added defensive type and `None` checking to Laterality Index calculations. During complete muscle relaxation periods (<3% RVE), when active APDF-50 cannot be calculated and `asymmetry_index` returns `None`, the display gracefully defaults to `0.00 (Symmetric)` without triggering NumPy ufunc casting exceptions.
4. **Realistic Mock Testing Setup**: Engineered `mock_data/generate_realistic_mock.py`, synthesizing a realistic 10-minute ergonomic workstation session (`TB_REALISTIC_10MIN_raw.csv`) incorporating variable %MVC work bursts, posture pauses, right-dominant mouse usage, low-frequency spectral fatigue drift, and an automated `tensionbudget_calibration.json` profile for rigorous offline validation.

- `chordspy/tensionbudget/config.py` — Updated `CHANNEL_MAP` to `{"left": 2, "right": 3}` (A2=Left / Channel3, A3=Right / Channel4).
- `chordspy/tensionbudget_app.py` — Fixed scoring engine dictionary key bindings, protected Asymmetry UI display against `None` values during resting states, and updated CSV loading logic to derive target columns directly from `CHANNEL_MAP`.
- `mock_data/generate_realistic_mock.py` — Created 10-minute realistic workstation EMG generator with automatic calibration profile creation.

## Phase 8.6 — Dual-Arduino Hardware Validation & LSL Synchronization Bridge
Timestamp: 2026-07-31T18:00:00+05:30
Status: Completed

### Summary
Successfully conducted our first live hardware testing session with physical Arduino hardware, leading to a critical architectural upgrade to support a **Dual-Arduino Bilateral Setup** (one board for Left shoulder, one for Right shoulder):
1. **Dedicated LSL Bridge Script (`start_lsl_stream.py`)**: Created a standalone multi-threaded USB-to-LSL synchronization bridge that connects simultaneously to two serial ports (`COM6` for Left trapezius on Analog Pin A2, `COM5` for Right trapezius on Analog Pin A2).
2. **Firmware Compatibility & Line-Ending Adaptation**: Discovered via custom buffer diagnostics that while COM6 transmitted standard binary frames terminated with `0x01` at 500 Hz, COM5 operated at 250 Hz and terminated frames with ASCII carriage returns (`0x0D` / `\r`). Updated the packet validation parser to universally accept `0x01`, `0x0D`, and `0x0A` frame terminators without packet loss or structural redesign.
3. **Synchronized Bilateral Upsampling**: Engineered a primary-pacemaker threading model where Left (COM6 @ 500 Hz) acts as the master clock for LSL sample broadcasting, performing automatic zero-order hold upsampling on Right (COM5 @ 250 Hz). This ensures an exact, zero-drift **500 Hz 2-channel bilateral stream** (Channel 0 = Left, Channel 1 = Right) over LSL.
4. **Configuration & Test Suite Alignment**: Updated `TBConfig.CHANNEL_MAP` to `{"left": 0, "right": 1}` and adjusted unit tests in `test_phase8_app.py` to match the dual-Arduino 2-channel LSL stream. Verified real-time live signal waveforms and moving RMS envelopes streaming cleanly into `tensionbudget_app.py`.

### Files created / modified
- `start_lsl_stream.py` — Created dual-threaded USB-to-LSL synchronization bridge supporting mixed baud rates and firmware frame terminators.
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/config.py` — Updated default `CHANNEL_MAP` to `{"left": 0, "right": 1}` for clean 2-channel bilateral ingestion.
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/tests/test_phase8_app.py` — Updated assertions to match `{"left": 0, "right": 1}`.
- `logs/session_log.md` — Appended Phase 8.6 hardware validation session summary.

## Phase 9 — Local Machine Learning Telemetry Logging, UI Subject Profiling & Collaborator Onboarding
Timestamp: 2026-08-01T11:00:00+05:30
Status: Completed

### Summary
Engineered a production-grade local logging subsystem (`chordspy/tensionbudget/local_logger.py`) to systematically capture structured feature vectors for downstream Machine Learning models and Cloud PostgreSQL ingestion without impacting high-speed visualization:
1. **The Two-Clock Architectural Principle**: Enforced complete operational separation between Clock 1 (In-memory real-time LSL processing and GUI rendering operating @ 500 Hz) and Clock 2 (Discrete summary feature extraction writing ML training vectors at scheduled epoch intervals).
2. **Subject Biometric Profiling & Storage Vaults**: Designed a standardized storage hierarchy under `output_logs/<User Name>/` (and user-specified `output-data/`). Automatically calculates dynamic age from birthdate and BMI from height/weight, persisting subject identities in a reusable `user_profile.json` along with session metadata JSON manifests and timestamps (`session_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_features.csv`).
3. **Interactive GUI Profiler Integration**: Modified `chordspy/tensionbudget_app.py` to display an interactive modal on initiation of either Live LSL monitoring or Offline CSV replay, collecting subject details, attaching active baseline calibration values (`ref_rms_left`/`ref_rms_right`), and logging epoch summaries automatically during the playback loop.
4. **Standalone Execution Bugfix**: Added explicit repository root injection into `sys.path` within `tensionbudget_app.py` to prevent `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'chordspy'` when executing directly from terminal environments.
5. **Collaborator Onboarding & Git Cleanliness**: Authored a complete setup manual (`TENSIONBUDGET_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md`) covering hardware connectivity, Python dependencies, and operational workflows. Re-engineered `.gitignore` to prevent Git commit bloat by excluding generated files >100MB, local telemetry logs, and personal biological calibration profiles (`tensionbudget_calibration.json`).

### Files created / modified
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/local_logger.py` — Created `LocalSessionLogger` class managing per-user directories, profile metadata, and feature vector CSV serialization.
- `chordspy/tensionbudget_app.py` — Integrated user profiling modal, linked epoch boundary triggers inside `update_loop`, and resolved standalone path import resolution.
- `TENSIONBUDGET_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md` — Authored comprehensive onboarding guide for collaborative team setup and offline replay validation.
- `.gitignore` — Added safety rules excluding `output_logs/`, large mock binary datasets, and temporary calibration JSON files.

## Phase 11 — STAMI Display-Scale Calibration, Cumulative EIndex Logging Fix & Spectral R² Quality Telemetry
Timestamp: 2026-08-02T22:29:10+05:30
Status: Completed

### Summary
Executed a multi-part architectural refinement and pilot diagnostic sprint addressing STAMI Norwegian working population display calibration, diagnosing and resolving silent CSV logging omissions, and introducing statistical regression quality telemetry:
1. **STAMI Norwegian Working Population Calibration (`map_eindex_to_display_scale`)**:
   - **SPSS Dataset & Scale Correction**: Corrected all documentation references from `S6_Dataset.csv` to **`S1_Dataset.sav` (SPSS format)** based on verified empirical audits. Resolved a crucial 100x scaling discrepancy: STAMI's stored proportions ($P_{\text{Rest}}$, $P_{\text{Low}}$, $P_{\text{High}}$) reside on a 0–100 percentage scale rather than a 0–1 fraction. Dividedraw formula results by 100 to establish precise population anchor constants in `TBConfig`: `EI_FLOOR = -3.854` (10th percentile restorative floor) and `EI_CEIL = 49.635` (90th percentile high-strain ceiling).
   - **Scoped Linear Clipping Transformation**: Replaced the `NotImplementedError` stub in `scoring.py` with `map_eindex_to_display_scale(cumulative_eindex)`. The function performs linear transformation to a `[0.0, 100.0]` clinical presentation scale while clamping outlier values at boundary limits.
   - **Strict Architectural Separation & Structural Guard**: Ensured display calibration applies **strictly and exclusively** to cumulative workday exposure (`eindex_session_cumulative`). Retained `ASYMMETRY_PENALTY_POINTS = 0.25` for unmapped real-time composite evaluation on the raw `[-2, +3]` domain. Created an automated AST/source-code structural regression test (`test_structural_guard_no_live_or_composite_mapping`) that scans all `.py` files in the repository to prevent accidental application of display scaling to live, per-side, or composite scores.

2. **Bug 1 Resolution — Cumulative EIndex Omission in CSV Telemetry**:
   - **Root Cause Analysis**: Investigated why `eindex_cumulative_left` and `eindex_cumulative_right` remained at `0.0` across all logged epochs in real user sessions. Discovered a twofold disconnect in `tensionbudget_app.py`: (1) `self.accumulator_l.submit_completed_window()` was defined in core scoring classes but never invoked during `update_loop()` or epoch transitions; and (2) during feature dictionary construction, the logger attempted to access `getattr(self.accumulator_l, "total_eindex", 0.0)`. Because the real property name is `eindex_session_cumulative`, Python silently defaulted to `0.0` on every logged row.
   - **Correction & Signal Envelope Polish**: Modified `tensionbudget_app.py` to persist normalized moving RMS arrays (`last_sub_norm_l/r`), trigger `submit_completed_window()` upon each epoch boundary transition, and correctly target `eindex_session_cumulative`. Additionally resolved a minor signal processing edge defect in `calculate_moving_rms` by changing `np.pad()` mode from `'constant'` (which injected default leading zero-padding) to `'edge'`.
   - **Automated Regression Suite**: Engineered an end-to-end GUI/logger integration test (`TestAppLoggerIntegration::test_cumulative_eindex_steps_upward_and_logs_cleanly`) in `test_phase8_app.py` that simulates multi-window playback sessions and verifies that cumulative EIndex increments upward across boundaries without freezing at `0.0`.

3. **Bug 2 Investigation & Spectral Fatigue R² / n_windows Telemetry**:
   - **Diagnostic Analysis of Extreme Slopes (`-196.08 Hz/min`)**: Explored why localized Median Power Frequency (MDF) fatigue slopes occasionally exhibited extreme spikes during pilot testing. Discovered that when an epoch boundary triggers during real-time tracking, the system logs `self.last_spec_res`, which is computed over the rolling GUI display buffer (`raw_left/right`). This buffer only retains **10 seconds of signal** (5,000 samples @ 500 Hz), producing at most 19 Welch windows. If a user performs a brief muscular burst lasting only 2–3 seconds, only 5–6 valid active windows exist—just enough to trigger linear regression (`SPECTRAL_MIN_VALID_WINDOWS = 5`). Because timestamps across a 3-second movement span only $\approx 0.05$ minutes, trivial frequency shifts of just $\pm 3.5\text{ Hz}$ are multiplied by $60\times$ when converting slope to $\text{Hz/min}$, creating artificial spikes like `-196 Hz/min`. The root physiological fix—running OLS regression across a full 5-minute epoch buffer—is explicitly deferred to Phase 12.
   - **R² & n_windows Quality Telemetry**: Added `mdf_r_squared_left`, `mdf_r_squared_right`, `n_windows_left`, and `n_windows_right` directly into `CSV_HEADER` and row serialization within `local_logger.py`. This provides read-only baseline diagnostic exposure to evaluate the effectiveness of the future Phase 12 buffer upgrade without altering underlying physiological detection thresholds.
   - **Granularity Re-evaluation**: Verified that within a 5-minute ($300\text{s}$) epoch, a continuous active session provides up to 599 potential Welch windows. At standard workstation active duty cycles (50–80%), an epoch should yield 300 to 450 valid windows—ensuring long-term OLS slope stability when spectral regression is transitioned to full epoch buffers in Phase 12.

4. **Processing Version Boundary Marker (`phase11_edge_padding`)**:
   - **Signal Processing Boundary Flag**: Introduced a mandatory `"processing_version": "phase11_edge_padding"` marker into all newly generated session metadata JSON files via `local_logger.py` and documented a warning note in `important_context.md`.
   - **ML Training Dataset Warning**: Because sessions recorded prior to Phase 11 utilized zero-padding (`'constant'`) RMS envelopes while post-Phase-11 sessions utilize edge-padding (`'edge'`), pre- and post-Phase 11 recordings are not numerically comparable for RMS-derived metrics near buffer boundaries (APDF, gaps, EIndex) and must not be pooled for ML training without explicit numerical correction or version segmentation.

### Files modified
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/config.py` — Added `EI_FLOOR = -3.854`, `EI_CEIL = 49.635`, and detailed STAMI SPSS documentation; confirmed asymmetry penalty points remain intact for raw scale.
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/scoring.py` — Implemented `map_eindex_to_display_scale()` with boundary clipping and population normative docstrings.
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/local_logger.py` — Updated `CSV_HEADER` and `log_epoch()` row writer to export `mdf_r_squared_left/right` and `n_windows_left/right`; injected `PROCESSING_VERSION` marker into metadata JSON manifests.
- `chordspy/tensionbudget_app.py` — Fixed cumulative EIndex logging by calling `submit_completed_window()` at epoch transitions, fixing accumulator property references (`eindex_session_cumulative`), and setting moving RMS padding to `'edge'`.
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/tests/test_phase6_scoring.py` — Added unit test suite `TestStamiMapping` covering endpoint mapping, boundary clipping, and AST structural guard checks against illegal mapping calls.
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/tests/test_phase8_app.py` — Added `TestAppLoggerIntegration` end-to-end integration regression test verifying upward step progression of cumulative EIndex across sequential logged epochs, inclusion of `n_windows_left` in CSV schemas, and `processing_version` metadata marking.
- `important_context.md` — Updated historical file references from `S6_Dataset.csv` to `S1_Dataset.sav`; appended item #18 warning against pooling pre/post-Phase 11 RMS datasets.

### Test Summary
- Verified **68 / 68 passing unit and integration tests** across `test_phase6_scoring.py`, `test_phase7_spectral.py`, and `test_phase8_app.py` (execution time: 9.86s).

### Next phase
Phase 12 — Full-Epoch Spectral Accumulation Upgrade & Cloud PostgreSQL Ingestion Pipelines. Completed.

## Phase 12 — Full-Epoch Spectral Accumulation Upgrade & Cloud PostgreSQL Ingestion Pipeline
Timestamp: 2026-08-03T14:30:00+05:30
Status: Completed

### Summary
Executed Phase 12 to resolve Bug 2's root physiological cause and engineer the cloud-ready PostgreSQL database ingestion pipeline for pilot ML datasets:
1. **Full-Epoch Spectral Accumulation Upgrade (Bug 2 Root Fix & Signal Tap Correction)**:
   - **Architectural Signal Tap Correction**: Incorporated a critical Stage 2 signal engineering correction: rather than accumulating unfiltered ADC outputs (which would leave mains interference and low-frequency motion drifts uncorrected in the analysis band), the epoch buffers (`epoch_filt_l/r`) explicitly accumulate **pre-rectified bandpass and notch filtered samples** (20–240 Hz and 50/60 Hz notch via stateful causal Second-Order Sections in `StreamingChannelProcessor`).
   - **Full 5-Minute Accumulation Buffer**: Modified `tensionbudget_app.py` to populate `epoch_filt_l/r` continuously during `update_loop()`, bounding maximum memory footprint to 150,000 samples ($300\text{s} \times 500\text{ Hz}$). When `_log_current_epoch()` triggers, Welch power spectral density and OLS linear regression (`analyze_bilateral_spectral_fatigue`) execute over the complete accumulated 5-minute buffer rather than the short 10s visualization GUI buffer.
   - **Memory Management & Window Volume**: Ensured `epoch_filt_l/r` arrays clear their contents instantly upon logging to free system memory. Verified that continuous active usage produces $\ge 300$ Welch windows per epoch (up from $\le 19$ on the 10s GUI buffer), mathematically eliminating erratic slope magnitude inflation under brief contractions.
   - **Automated Verification Suite**: Created unit and integration tests (`test_phase12_spectral_epoch.py`) confirming $>20\text{ dB}$ attenuation of out-of-band low-frequency drifts, $\ge 300$ observed window counts in logged CSV telemetry, memory clearance upon epoch transitions, and OLS slope bounded stability ($< 15\text{ Hz/min}$) during simulated 3-second muscular bursts.

2. **Cloud PostgreSQL & ML Relational Database Ingestion Engine**:
   - **3-Tier Privacy & Telemetry Schema (`cloud_schema.py`)**: Built universal relational DDL definitions for SQLite local testing and cloud PostgreSQL deployment across four core tables: Tier 1 (`user_profiles`), Tier 2 (`sessions` metadata vault), Tier 3 (`epoch_features` and `self_reports`), and a wide-format SQL view (`v_ml_training_pairs`) combining user demographics and calibration references directly with longitudinal epoch features.
   - **Idempotent Ingestion & Version Segmentation (`cloud_ingest.py`)**: Developed an automated synchronization engine that scans local log directories (`output_logs/`, `output-data/`) for paired `*_metadata.json` and `*_features.csv` manifests. The engine executes idempotent upserts (`ON CONFLICT` style check-and-update behavior) ensuring repeated synchronizations produce zero duplicate rows.
   - **Legacy Version Tagging**: Automatically detects pre-Phase 11 pilot sessions that lack the `processing_version` JSON field and assigns them `"processing_version": "legacy_constant_padding"`, preventing uncorrected pooling with modern edge-padded recordings during ML model training.
   - **Explicit Missingness Normalization**: Translates resting frequency empty strings (`""` in MDF/MNF during muscular silence) to SQL `NULL` while retaining explicit boolean flags (`mdf_computed_left/right`, `is_fatiguing_left/right`), safeguarding ML models from false zero imputations.
   - **CLI Synchronization Utility (`scripts/ingest_to_postgres.py`)**: Designed a clean command-line synchronization tool with ASCII formatting for cross-platform Windows terminal execution and automated summary reporting.

3. **Dependency Decoupling in `chordspy`**:
   - Updated `chordspy/__init__.py` with optional `try-except ImportError` handling around top-level app and BLE connection imports, enabling lightweight execution of standalone data scripts and test suites without requiring hardware drivers (`bleak`, `pylsl`, `pyserial`).

### Files created / modified
- `chordspy/tensionbudget_app.py` — Added `StreamingChannelProcessor` instances for left/right channels, integrated filtered epoch sample accumulation into `update_loop()`, routed full-epoch arrays to spectral fatigue evaluation in `_log_current_epoch()`, and added buffer clearing.
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/cloud_schema.py` — Created 3-Tier relational SQL schema definitions and ML training view `v_ml_training_pairs` for SQLite and PostgreSQL.
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/cloud_ingest.py` — Built idempotent batch ingestion engine with missingness normalization and legacy processing version segmentation.
- `scripts/ingest_to_postgres.py` — Created CLI synchronization command-line interface tool.
- `chordspy/__init__.py` — Decoupled top-level package imports from hardware BLE driver dependencies.
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/tests/test_phase12_spectral_epoch.py` — Added unit and integration test suite proving Stage 2 filter tap attenuation, $\ge 300$ window volume, slope stability under short bursts, and memory clearing.
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/tests/test_phase12_cloud_ingest.py` — Added test suite verifying DDL creation, SQL view output, idempotent upserting, NULL missingness conversion, and legacy session tagging.

### Test Summary
- Executed and verified **73 / 73 passing unit and integration tests** across Phases 1 through 12 (`pytest chordspy/tensionbudget/tests/ -v`, execution time: 12.82s).
- Successfully validated live synchronization against real pilot recordings in `output-data/`, accurately segmenting 2 legacy zero-padded sessions and storing all 7 epoch rows cleanly without duplications on repeated runs.

### Next phase
Phase 13 / Web Deployment (Phases W1–W6) — Web Serial + Pyodide Browser Bridge & Cloud Backend Infrastructure.

---

## 2026-08-03 — Phase W1 Complete & Architectural Documentation Reconciliation

### Context & Objectives
Followed up on user review of the Web Deployment / ML-Ready Cloud Architecture plan (Phases W1–W6). Addressed three mandatory doc/schema fixes and confirmed crucial architectural policies before initiating Phase W1 implementation:
1. **Fix 1 (Epoch Cadence Standardization)**: Corrected stale references to "10-minute" epoch logging intervals across all architectural documents and `cloud_schema.py` docstrings, standardizing strictly on **5-minute epochs (300 seconds)** to match live execution math in `tensionbudget_app.py` line 500 (`self.sampling_rate * 300`) and double ML row density.
2. **Fix 2 (Telemetry Fields Integration)**: Updated all entity relationship diagrams and specifications to explicitly incorporate `mdf_r_squared_left/right` (regression quality diagnostic), `n_windows_left/right` (buffer volume validation), and `processing_version` on `sessions` (legacy zero-padded vs. edge-padded boundary tracking).
3. **Fix 3 (Canonical Table Reconcilation)**: Harmonized the Web App database schema directly with Phase 12's authoritative DDL in `cloud_schema.py` Table 1 (`user_profiles`), Table 2 (`sessions`), and Table 3 (`epoch_features`), preventing structural drift between desktop CLI ingestion and cloud API endpoints.
4. **Architectural Confirmation & Policy Exceptions**:
   - Explicitly logged the **Scoped Raw Signal Policy Exception**: for the web deployment path only, raw 500 Hz sEMG sample streams exist solely in temporary client browser RAM for calculation and visualization, vanishing on tab closure without network upload to prevent bandwidth exhaustion and biological privacy exposure. Confirmed that local desktop execution logs (`output_logs/`) remain sacred and continue storing full raw waveform archives as originally mandated.
   - Documented hardware awareness regarding the COM5 vs. COM6 250 Hz effective-Nyquist discrepancy, noting that switching from `pyserial` to browser Web Serial changes the transport layer without altering underlying dual Arduino firmware timing characteristics.

### Work accomplished & verified

1. **Schema & Document Standardization**:
   - Reconciled [cloud_schema.py](file:///C:/Users/mohit/Downloads/Chords-Python-main/Chords-Python-main/chordspy/tensionbudget/cloud_schema.py) docstrings, [implementation_plan_deployement](file:///C:/Users/mohit/Downloads/Chords-Python-main/Chords-Python-main/implementation_plan_deployement), and [cloud_database_and_ml_schema_specification.md](file:///C:/Users/mohit/Downloads/Chords-Python-main/Chords-Python-main/cloud_database_and_ml_schema_specification.md) (both root and brain artifact copies) with complete 36-column feature matrices, 5-minute epoch cadences, and explicit missingness boolean indicators.

2. **Phase W1 Deliverable — Web Serial + Pyodide Wasm Bridge Spike (`web_spike/`)**:
   - **Zero DSP Rewrite Enforcement**: Developed a standalone browser verification environment in `web_spike/` that executes our canonical Python signal processing math (Second-Order Butterworth bandpass 20–240 Hz and notch filtering) unmodified within Pyodide WebAssembly.
   - **[server.py](file:///C:/Users/mohit/Downloads/Chords-Python-main/Chords-Python-main/web_spike/server.py)**: Engineered a zero-dependency local Python HTTP development server on port 8000 configured with Cross-Origin resource sharing and CoOP/CoEP headers to maximize Wasm thread concurrency and timer resolution.
   - **[worker.js](file:///C:/Users/mohit/Downloads/Chords-Python-main/Chords-Python-main/web_spike/worker.js)**: Constructed a dedicated Pyodide Web Worker that dynamically downloads NumPy and SciPy via CDN, instantiates stateful `WasmStreamingProcessor` instances for left and right channels, and incorporates an automated **1,000-chunk latency stress benchmark** (50,000 samples) evaluating statistical execution durations (Mean, Median, P95, Max) against the sub-10 ms SLA requirement.
   - **[index.html](file:///C:/Users/mohit/Downloads/Chords-Python-main/Chords-Python-main/web_spike/index.html) & [index.css](file:///C:/Users/mohit/Downloads/Chords-Python-main/Chords-Python-main/web_spike/index.css)**: Built an ultra-premium dark mode glassmorphism UI styled with neon cyan/purple HSL color palettes, responsive telemetry grids, accessible hardware controls, and unique descriptive element IDs.
   - **[app.js](file:///C:/Users/mohit/Downloads/Chords-Python-main/Chords-Python-main/web_spike/app.js)**: Implemented dual Web Serial hardware gateway bindings (`navigator.serial` for COM6 / COM5 equivalents), an interactive real-time 500 Hz stream emulator, 50 Hz canvas waveform animation engines, and automated verification autorun logic.

### Files created / modified
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/cloud_schema.py` — Updated docstring cadence references to 5-minute intervals.
- `implementation_plan_deployement` — Overwritten with reconciled 5-minute cadence, complete 3-Tier canonical ERD, telemetry quality fields (`mdf_r_squared`, `n_windows`, `processing_version`), and scoped raw data exception policies.

## Phase W2 — Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling Foundation, Borg CR-10 Continuous Scale & 38-Column Schema Standardization
Timestamp: 2026-08-04T07:55:00+05:30
Status: Completed

### Summary
Executed a comprehensive architectural upgrade to establish the foundation for Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling and ordinal regression on subjective muscular fatigue, eliminating historical missing-data sentinels and standardizing all local data archives:
1. **Full 0–10 Borg CR-10 Continuous Scale Adoption**:
   - **Variance Preservation for Ordinal Regression**: Replaced the restrictive 4-point discrete scale (which collapsed perceived strain into anchor values 1, 5, 8, 10) with the complete continuous `[0.0, 10.0]` Borg CR-10 domain in `config.py` (`STRAIN_SCALE_MIN = 0.0`, `STRAIN_SCALE_MAX = 10.0`). Preserving full scale resolution is critical for Bayesian Hierarchical Models and ordinal regression, where artificial categorization destroys variance.
   - **Standardized Verbal Anchor Definitions**: Defined canonical descriptions for all integer anchors from `0` (Nothing at all / Complete Rest) to `10` (Absolute maximum / Intolerable pain/fatigue).
2. **Elimination of `-1.0` Sentinel via Explicit `strain_reported` Boolean Flag**:
   - **Prior Contamination Guard**: Identified and eliminated a severe statistical regression bug where unrecorded strain ratings were stored as `-1.0`. In Bayesian modeling, ingesting `-1.0` without manual SQL filtering would falsely treat unreported epochs as "more relaxed than complete rest," severely distorting prior distributions and target coefficients.
   - **Explicit Missingness Convention**: Adopted the exact dual-column convention established for spectral fatigue (`mdf_computed`):
     1. Added a dedicated boolean column `strain_reported` (`INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` in PostgreSQL DDL and `"1"` or `"0"` in CSV telemetry).
     2. When strain is unrecorded or skipped, `subjective_strain_cr10` is written as an empty string `""` in local CSV files and as SQL `NULL` in the cloud database.
3. **Multi-Interface UI & Dashboard Upgrades**:
   - **Desktop Monitor (`tensionbudget_app.py`)**: Upgraded the interactive strain selection dropdown to populate all integers 0 through 10 along with their verbal descriptions, plus an explicit index-0 option: `[NULL] Unreported / Skip (strain_reported = 0)`. Updated target variable handlers to pass `None` when unreported.
   - **Web Spike Dashboard (`web_spike/index.html` & `app.js`)**: Replaced the 4-point buttons with a **Continuous 0.0–10.0 Interactive Slider** (half-point resolution), direct clickable integer buttons for 0 through 10, and a dedicated **`[NULL] Unreported / Skip (Flag 0)`** button.
4. **Repository-Wide Historical Session Log Standardization (38-Column Schema)**:
   - **Schema Alignment**: Engineered and executed an automated migration utility across all existing feature log CSV files in `output-data/` and `output_logs/` (`session_20260802_181623_features.csv`, `session_20260803_221657_features.csv`, etc.).
   - **Universal 38-Column Matrix**: Standardized all historical recordings to our authoritative 38-column format terminating in `mdf_computed_right, is_fatiguing_right, strain_reported, subjective_strain_cr10`. All legacy missing-data sentinels (`-1` or `-1.0`) and absent target columns were cleanly migrated to `,0,` (`strain_reported = 0`, `subjective_strain_cr10 = ""`).

### Files modified
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/config.py` — Updated scale minimum/maximum constants and descriptions to full 0–10 Borg CR-10 domain.
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/local_logger.py` — Added `strain_reported` column to `CSV_HEADER`; updated `log_epoch()` to serialize empty string `""` for unrecorded ratings and set explicit `strain_reported` flag.
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/cloud_schema.py` — Added `strain_reported INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` column to Table 3 (`epoch_features`); updated `subjective_strain_cr10` default to `REAL DEFAULT NULL`.
- `chordspy/tensionbudget_app.py` — Upgraded GUI dropdown menu to full 0–10 domain + NULL unrecorded option; updated logging call to pass `None` when unrecorded.
- `web_spike/index.html` — Updated UI with 0–10 continuous slider, 0–10 integer buttons, and NULL unrecorded button.
- `web_spike/app.js` — Replaced Target $y$ event handler logic with continuous slider input resolution, integer buttons, and explicit NULL flag display updating.
- `output-data/*_features.csv` & `output_logs/*/*_features.csv` — Migrated all historical session datasets across the repository to the uniform 38-column schema with clean missing-data flags.

### Test Summary
- Executed and verified **73 / 73 passing unit and regression tests** (`python -m pytest -v`, execution time: 3.37s) with zero regressions in mathematical calculations or cloud schema initialization.

### Next phase

## Phase W3 — Dedicated Session Vault, 500 Hz Raw Telemetry Streaming & Interactive Borg CR-10 Popup Dialogs
Timestamp: 2026-08-04T21:00:00+05:30
Status: Completed

### Summary
Implemented three major structural upgrades across our local data persistence layer, high-frequency waveform recording engine, and graphical user interface to fulfill Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling capabilities and eliminate missed self-reports:
1. **Dedicated Session Directories (`output_logs/<user>/session_<timestamp>/`)**:
   - Refactored `LocalSessionLogger` (`chordspy/tensionbudget/local_logger.py`) to abandon flat file clobbering in favor of dedicated, self-contained subdirectories per session.
   - Each recording session now outputs a perfectly matched trio of artifacts: `session_<timestamp>_metadata.json`, `session_<timestamp>_features.csv` (Clock 2 38-column summary matrix), and `session_<timestamp>_raw.csv`.
   - Upgraded database synchronization (`chordspy/tensionbudget/cloud_ingest.py`) to implement recursive pattern globbing (`**/*_metadata.json`), ensuring seamless cloud database ingestion across deep folder trees.
2. **500 Hz Raw Telemetry Archival & Relational `epoch_index` Binding (`_raw.csv`)**:
   - Implemented `log_raw_chunk()` in `LocalSessionLogger` to buffer incoming high-frequency 500 Hz multichannel sEMG samples in RAM and flush to disk cleanly once per second (500-sample chunks), completely insulating Windows IO disk throughput from 50 Hz UI rendering loops.
   - Designed and locked `RAW_CSV_HEADER` (`sample_index, timestamp_s, epoch_index, raw_adc_left, raw_adc_right`). Every raw electrical sample is relationally bound to its corresponding 5-minute `epoch_index`, keeping `session_raw.csv` completely pure as an untouched Stage-1 physical acquisition stream without mixing derived target reports. Downstream modeling joins waveforms to sparse self-report feature targets via SQL or PyTorch (`SELECT * FROM raw JOIN features USING (epoch_index) WHERE f.strain_reported = 1`).
3. **Interactive Borg CR-10 Popup Modal (`BorgStrainPopupDialog`)**:
   - Engineered an asynchronous, non-blocking modal dialog window (`BorgStrainPopupDialog(QDialog)`) in `chordspy/tensionbudget_app.py` that automatically triggers when a 5-minute epoch boundary (`300` seconds) is crossed during live hardware monitoring.
   - **No Thread Blocking**: Opens via `.open(lambda: ...)`, permitting background 500 Hz serial acquisition and live canvas plotting to proceed without losing a single LSL data frame while awaiting subject input.
   - **No Forward-Filling / Stale Defaults**: Resolves prior subjective strain data leakage by logging submitted Borg CR-10 ratings directly into `_features.csv`, immediately resetting the active interface selection back to `[NULL] Unreported / Skip` for future epochs.

### Files modified
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/local_logger.py` — Implemented session subdirectory creation, 5-column pure `RAW_CSV_HEADER`, `log_raw_chunk()`, and `flush_raw_buffer()`.
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/cloud_ingest.py` — Upgraded file discovery loop in `ingest_directory` to recursive glob pattern (`**/*_metadata.json`).
- `chordspy/tensionbudget_app.py` — Added PyQt5 dialog imports, implemented `BorgStrainPopupDialog`, integrated raw telemetry streaming in `update_loop`, and wired asynchronous popup triggering via `_trigger_epoch_logging()`.
- `TENSIONBUDGET_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md` — Documented 5-minute epoch cadence, dedicated session folder architecture, raw waveform logs, and interactive popup dialog behaviors.

### Test Summary
- Executed and verified **73 / 73 passing unit, math, and regression tests** (`python -m pytest -v`, execution time: 32.98s) with zero regressions in mathematical calculations, spectral fatigue slopes, or EIndex bounding.

## Phase W4 — Parquet High-Frequency Storage Upgrade, Web Session Vault Downloads & Multi-Tab Excel Converter Utility
Timestamp: 2026-08-04T23:30:00+05:30
Status: Completed

### Summary
Resolved all deferred offline export and web browser archival requirements while solving high-frequency file size bloat through modern columnar disk storage:
1. **Automated `.parquet` Compression Upgrade (`LocalSessionLogger.end_session`)**:
   - Upgraded `chordspy/tensionbudget/local_logger.py` to convert uncompressed temporary `_raw.csv` files into compressed Apache Parquet (`_raw.parquet`) archives immediately upon session termination (relying on `pandas` and `pyarrow`/`fastparquet`). This reduces multi-hour 500 Hz bilateral sEMG disk footprints by >80% while accelerating downstream Python/PyTorch data ingestion speeds.
2. **Multi-Tab Excel Export Utility (`scripts/export_raw_to_excel.py`)**:
   - Engineered a robust command-line utility (`scripts/export_raw_to_excel.py`) capable of parsing massive `.parquet` or `.csv` raw recordings and converting them into partitioned `.xlsx` Excel workbooks.
   - **Row Limit Guard:** Automatically segments datasets exceeding Excel's ~1,048,576 row limit into sequential 800,000-row tabs (`Raw_Part1`, `Raw_Part2`), guaranteeing physical therapists and ergonomists can open multi-hour waveform logs in Microsoft Excel without truncated data crashes.
3. **Web Spike Session Vault Suite (`web_spike/index.html` & `app.js`)**:
   - Built an interactive **Session Vault Data Export Deck** directly inside the WebAssembly browser workspace.
   - Empowered web-based monitoring sessions to execute zero-network client-side Blob generation for three distinct local downloads: **500Hz Raw Waveform Archive (`_raw.csv`)**, **38-Column Feature Matrix (`_features.csv`)**, and **Session Manifest JSON (`_metadata.json`)**, matching desktop offline persistence without cloud data leak risks.

### Files modified
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/local_logger.py` — Added Parquet conversion on `end_session()` with safe fallback to CSV preservation if engine imports are missing.
- `scripts/export_raw_to_excel.py` — Created standalone multi-tab Excel partitioning CLI tool.
- `web_spike/index.html` — Built UI download controls for Raw, Features, and Metadata archives under the Session Vault panel.
- `web_spike/app.js` — Built in-memory sample archiving arrays and trigger Blob download handlers.

### Test Summary
- Verified complete test suite: **73 / 73 tests passed** (`python -m pytest -v`) with zero regression in logger teardown or feature scoring calculations.

## Phase W5 — Automatic Hardware Serial Port Discovery & Schema Harmonization
Timestamp: 2026-08-05T09:30:00+05:30
Status: Completed

### Summary
Eliminated hardcoded COM port dependencies across all hardware bridging tools to support multi-platform plug-and-play operation across diverse workstation hardware:
1. **Dynamic USB/Serial Hardware Auto-Discovery (`start_lsl_stream.py`)**:
   - Replaced hardcoded `COM6` and `COM5` serial constants with intelligent operating system scan routines using `serial.tools.list_ports.comports()`.
   - Automatically identifies connected Arduino/USB acquisition devices across Windows (`COMx`), macOS (`/dev/cu.usbserial-xxx`), and Linux (`/dev/ttyACM0`) architectures and assigns them to Left and Right trapezius streaming gateways.
   - Added command-line argument override switches (`--left COM3 --right COM4`) allowing advanced researchers to manually force custom port assignments when operating with complex hardware setups.
2. **Web Serial UI Standardization (`web_spike/`)**:
   - Stripped misleading hardcoded `"COM6"` and `"COM5"` display strings from Web Serial connection buttons in `web_spike/index.html` and `app.js` (`🔌 Link Left Trapezius Gateway`, `🔌 Link Right Trapezius Gateway`), ensuring UI presentation cleanly aligns with the native browser COM selection dialogs.
3. **Cloud Database & ML Schema Specification Reconcilation**:
   - Reconciled [cloud_database_and_ml_schema_specification.md](file:///C:/Users/mohit/Downloads/Chords-Python-main/Chords-Python-main/cloud_database_and_ml_schema_specification.md) with our authoritative 38-column epoch feature vector, documenting our explicit missing-data rules (`strain_reported = 0`, `subjective_strain_cr10 = NULL` without forward-fill imputation to protect Bayesian prior distributions from sample size $N$ pseudo-replication) and Parquet high-frequency relational joining rules.

### Files modified
- `start_lsl_stream.py` — Implemented `auto_detect_serial_ports()`, added CLI parsing via `argparse`, and replaced hardcoded COM strings with dynamic port variables.
- `web_spike/index.html` & `web_spike/app.js` — Generalized button labels to remove COM port hardcoding.
- `TENSIONBUDGET_ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md` — Updated hardware onboarding steps to instruct users on automatic COM discovery and CLI override options.
- `cloud_database_and_ml_schema_specification.md` — Updated Tier 3 schema definitions, Parquet standards, and relational join architecture.

### Test Summary
- Executed full test suite: **73 / 73 tests passed in 18.13s** (`python -m pytest -v`), confirming completely intact math and database table schema integrity.
- Verified CLI overrides and argument parsing via `python start_lsl_stream.py --help`.

### Next phase & Planned Deliverables
1. **Database Connectivity & Cloud Ingestion Execution (Active Milestone)**:
   - Perform end-to-end cloud database linking verification. Test live data ingestion from local session folders into an operational PostgreSQL/Supabase instance (utilizing `scripts/ingest_to_postgres.py` and `cloud_ingest.py` with valid connection secrets).
2. **Ergonomic UI Interpretation Engine & Coaching Dashboards (Deferred until DB Linking Complete)**:
   - Implement an automated interpretation module (`interpretation.py`) designed to convert raw statistical metrics (fatigue regression slopes, EIndex curves, Asymmetry Index) into intelligible, human-readable coaching guidance for non-technical users.
   - Add real-time visual coaching banners/gauges to both Desktop Monitor and Web UI screens, and introduce a comprehensive **Post-Session Report & Analysis Scorecard Modal** shown automatically upon concluding a recording session.

## Phase W6 — Password-Gated Data Integrity & Serverless Web Ingestion Firewall
Timestamp: 2026-08-05T11:10:00+05:30
Status: Completed

### Summary
Designed and validated a streamlined password-gated write authorization system across both desktop and web data ingestion pathways, safeguarding our shared Bayesian pilot database (~10-15 subjects) against accidental data corruption and misattributed session merging without heavy Supabase Auth / JWT / RLS overhead:
1. **Architectural & Threat Model Alignment**:
   - Clarified that for our small, trusted cohort of ~10-15 pilot subjects, full Supabase Auth / JWT / RLS machinery is unnecessary complexity. The primary threat model is accidental data corruption (e.g., researcher or subject mistyping an existing subject's name and silently merging session telemetry into that subject's records).
   - Recognized the distinct security boundary between the **Desktop Sync Path** (trusted local scripts connecting via service/admin credentials where RLS is bypassed by design) and the **Web Sync Path** (where client-side JS password validation would be insecure against browser developer tools bypasses, requiring a server-side enforcement checkpoint).
2. **Minimalist Schema Modification (`user_profiles` only)**:
   - Updated `user_profiles` DDL in `chordspy/tensionbudget/cloud_schema.py` by adding `password_hash TEXT` and `created_via TEXT DEFAULT 'desktop_registration'`.
   - Preserved complete relational immutability for `sessions`, `epoch_features`, `self_reports`, and `alert_events` (zero alterations to any telemetry tables).
   - Implemented non-breaking runtime migration fallbacks (`ALTER TABLE user_profiles ADD COLUMN...`) within `create_schema_sqlite()` to seamlessly upgrade existing databases without data loss.
3. **Desktop Password Gating & Integrity Enforcement**:
   - Engineered standard library salted PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 encryption (`hash_password` and `verify_password`) within `chordspy/tensionbudget/cloud_ingest.py`, requiring zero third-party pip dependencies.
   - Updated `ingest_session_pair()` and `ingest_directory()` to intercept write operations: on first session sync for a new subject, a password hash is securely recorded. On all subsequent sync attempts under an existing subject's name, the typed password is verified *before* executing any SQL insertions or updates.
   - On password mismatch, ingestion immediately throws a `PermissionError("Data Integrity Error: Invalid or missing password...")`, rejecting the session write and preventing silent data corruption.
   - Expanded CLI utility `scripts/ingest_to_postgres.py` with `--password <secret>` for unattended batch pipelines and `--interactive` for terminal password prompting.
4. **Serverless Web Endpoint Firewall**:
   - Created a dedicated serverless Edge Function in [supabase/functions/ingest-session/index.ts](file:///C:/Users/mohit/Downloads/Chords-Python-main/Chords-Python-main/supabase/functions/ingest-session/index.ts) using Deno and Web Crypto API PBKDF2 derivation.
   - Built a parallel Python HTTP serverless endpoint handler in [scripts/web_endpoint_server.py](file:///C:/Users/mohit/Downloads/Chords-Python-main/Chords-Python-main/scripts/web_endpoint_server.py) for local staging, Fast-WSGI proxying, or Vercel serverless functions.
   - Both serverless functions act as the single trusted enforcement checkpoint between browser Wasm clients and the PostgreSQL/SQLite database. They accept `{ user_name, password, session_metadata, epoch_features }`, verify credentials server-side using database service keys (which never touch browser memory), and return **HTTP 403 Forbidden** on authentication mismatch while committing rows on success.

### Files modified & Created
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/cloud_schema.py` — [MODIFY] Added `password_hash` and `created_via` columns to `user_profiles` DDL with safe runtime `ALTER TABLE` fallbacks.
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/cloud_ingest.py` — [MODIFY] Built `hash_password` / `verify_password` stdlib utilities and integrated password check gates prior to executing SQL writes in `ingest_session_pair` and `ingest_directory`.
- `scripts/ingest_to_postgres.py` — [MODIFY] Updated CLI argument parser with `--password` and `--interactive` switches and structured integrity rejection reports.
- `supabase/functions/ingest-session/index.ts` — [NEW] Created production-ready Deno/Web Crypto serverless Edge Function acting as the web ingestion firewall.
- `scripts/web_endpoint_server.py` — [NEW] Created standalone Python HTTP serverless endpoint handler mirroring the Edge Function for immediate testability and deployment flexibility.
- `scripts/verify_password_gating.py` — [NEW] Engineered automated end-to-end verification script testing both Desktop and Web pathways against registration, authorized sync, and corruption-blocked unauthorized syncs.

### Test Summary
- Executed full test suite: **73 / 73 tests passed in 15.51s** (`python -m pytest -v`), confirming zero regressions in mathematical feature scoring, signal processing, or schema initialization.
- Executed automated write-through validation suite: **All tests passed** (`python -m scripts.verify_password_gating`):
  - **Desktop Path 1A/1B:** Successfully registered subject (`created_via='desktop_registration'`) and authorized follow-up session sync using valid credentials.
  - **Desktop Path 1C (Corruption Defense):** Confirmed attempted ingestion with wrong/mistyped password immediately triggered `PermissionError` and resulted in **0 corrupted rows admitted to the database**.
  - **Web Path 2A/2B:** Successfully registered subject via HTTP POST to endpoint (`created_via='web_endpoint'`) and authorized subsequent HTTP session ingestion (HTTP 200).
  - **Web Path 2C (Server-Side Defense):** Confirmed HTTP POST with invalid password resulted in **HTTP 403 Forbidden** server rejection and **0 corrupted rows written to database**, proving complete data integrity protection without browser credential exposure.

### Next phase & Planned Deliverables
1. **Live Cloud Database Connectivity Verification**: Completed (See Phase 13 below).
2. **Ergonomic UI Interpretation Engine & Coaching Dashboards (Pending)**:
   - Build `interpretation.py` to translate statistical fatigue metrics into non-technical coaching feedback.
   - Incorporate real-time coaching banner gauges and post-session analysis scorecard modals into both Desktop GUI and Web Wasm interfaces.

## Phase 13 / W7 — Live Cloud Database Deployment, Dual-Path Smoke Testing & Team Collaboration Setup
Timestamp: 2026-08-05T13:15:00+05:30
Status: Completed

### Summary
Successfully deployed, verified, and bulletproofed live cloud database connectivity against production Supabase instance (`khsrpxzckidhmzdpihfu`). During field testing, empirically confirmed that enterprise and campus networks actively block direct PostgreSQL connection ports (`5432`/`6543`). To guarantee uninterrupted pilot data collection regardless of network firewall rules, we permanently adapted the entire Desktop synchronization architecture (`cloud_ingest.py`, `local_logger.py`, `ingest_to_postgres.py`) to default to standard **HTTPS Edge Function transport over Port 443**, bypassing firewall restrictions while preserving direct PostgreSQL connections behind an explicit `--direct` opt-in flag.

We pruned the redundant legacy `self_reports` table, establishing a finalized 3-table relational schema (`user_profiles`, `sessions`, `epoch_features`) and one ML extraction view (`v_ml_training_pairs`). To prevent duplicate key errors during redundant batch uploads, our Deno serverless Edge Function (`index.ts`) was augmented with explicit `{ onConflict: "session_id,epoch_index" }` conflict handling and defensive parameter enrichment, ensuring 100% idempotency.

To support seamless team collaboration without exposing credentials to Git version control, we added a zero-dependency environment auto-loader in `config.py` and generated a `.env.example` deployment template. Furthermore, we verified and documented that **local disk storage remains the unconditional primary source of truth**: GUI sessions save complete feature CSVs, metadata manifests, and compressed raw Parquet waveform arrays directly to `output_logs/` offline before attempting optional post-session background cloud synchronization.

### Files Modified & Created
- `scripts/export_postgres_ddl.py` — [NEW] Automated DDL exporter generating clean PostgreSQL/Supabase copy-paste installation statements.
- `.env.example` — [NEW] Team onboarding credential template file (safe for Git commits).
- `.env` — [NEW] Local git-ignored credential repository containing active project anon key and endpoint URL.
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/config.py` — [MODIFIED] Added zero-dependency `.env` file auto-loader so any module importing `TBConfig` automatically inherits credentials into `os.environ`.
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/cloud_schema.py` — [MODIFIED] Removed redundant `self_reports` table DDL and duplicate column references in ML view; refined docstrings to reinforce 5-minute (300s) epoch methodology.
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/cloud_ingest.py` — [MODIFIED] Added pure Python `urllib` HTTP POST transmission logic targeting our Edge Function Gateway over HTTPS Port 443 as the primary desktop sync protocol.
- `chordspy/tensionbudget/local_logger.py` — [MODIFIED] Verified disk-first offline persistence guarantees and adapted automatic post-session cloud sync triggers to route via HTTPS Port 443 by default.
- `scripts/ingest_to_postgres.py` — [MODIFIED] Disabled dangerous network runtime schema initialization (directing developers to SQL Editor DDL execution or local SQLite `--init-schema` testing) and implemented `--endpoint`/`--direct` switching.
- `supabase/functions/ingest-session/index.ts` — [MODIFIED] Implemented explicit `onConflict` resolution on `(session_id, epoch_index)` and defensive fallback field enrichment.
- `scripts/run_live_smoke_tests.py` — [MODIFIED] Upgraded test runner to evaluate both Desktop Path 1 and Web Path 2 over standard HTTPS Port 443 with live PostgREST read-back persistence validation.

### Verification & Test Results
- **Unit & Integration Suite:** Executed `python -m pytest -v`, achieving **73 / 73 tests passed (100%) in 20.43s**.
- **Live Cloud Dual-Path Smoke Test Harness:** Executed `python -m scripts.run_live_smoke_tests` over HTTPS Port 443 against live cloud project `khsrpxzckidhmzdpihfu`:
  - **Path 1 (Desktop HTTPS Transport):** Transmitted subject telemetry, confirmed HTTP 200 Success response, and validated physical persistence in PostgreSQL via independent PostgREST queries over Port 443.
  - **Path 2 (Web Serverless Gateway & Security Firewall):** Confirmed authorized session ingestion (HTTP 200) and confirmed absolute defense against simulated data corruption/mistyped passwords with HTTP 403 Forbidden rejection, admitting **0 corrupted rows**.
  - **Idempotency Verification:** Demonstrated that re-uploading identical sessions cleanly updates existing rows via `onConflict` rules without throwing unique constraint violations.

### Next phase & Planned Deliverables
1. **Ergonomic UI Interpretation Engine & Coaching Dashboards**:
   - Build `interpretation.py` to translate statistical fatigue metrics into non-technical coaching feedback.
   - Incorporate real-time coaching banner gauges and post-session analysis scorecard modals into both Desktop GUI and Web Wasm interfaces.
